<h2>Ampere Analysis - Python Developer (September 2016 - 2020)</h2>


<p>
The team I worked with was responsible for providing a data analytics product which spanned millions of movies and TV shows across all well known subscription video services active in dozens of countries.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Key Projects:</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Built web scrapers which could reliably scrape data from large websites with thousands of pages. Achieving this required many concurrent worker processes as well as automatic IP switching when the client was blocked. These projects required not only python expertise, but also a knowledge of web fundamentals.

<li>Created the cloud infrastructure for the automation of scrapers on elastic cloud computing and the storing of data with Postgres. This required knowledge of several AWS services such as S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda, Cloudwatch and Batch. This project also utilised Docker so that the cloud computing instances had access to all of the necessary dependencies. The cloud computers were Linux based, and so some familiarity with Linux and bash scripts was necessary.

<li>Built a web portal for the non-developer team members to use when interacting with the AWS infrastructure (such as re-scheduling when a scraper runs). This was built with Django and Boto3.

<li>Mentoring new employees.
</li>
</ul>

<li>I made a demo CRUD app for sharing regex snippets. It is built with Django rest framework and Vue JS. <a href="https://github.com/PeterGSWhite/reggitapi">https://github.com/PeterGSWhite/reggitapi</a>
